<span style="font-size: 34px;">**Summary**</span>

This report presents a comprehensive performance benchmarking analysis of ArangoDB deployed in three distinct configurations on Azure: <span style="color:red;">**a Single Instance, Split Databases, and Clustering.**</span>  The aim was to include the best performing configurations and the most cost-efficient setups. It will highlight the FTPS value as a critical performance metric and its impact on choosing the right configuration for deployment.

**Note** The Arangodb Clustering is only available for a licensed deployment of ArangoDB.

The highest **FTPS** that was reached was <span style="color:green; font-size: 16px;">****2496.83****</span> using the **4 SplitDB** approach of Arango.

**2 SplitDB:** <span style="color:green; font-size: 16px;">****2304.5****</span> **FTPS**

**Standalone** (Single Instance)**:** <span style="color:green; font-size: 16px;">****2240****</span> **FTPS**

**Cluster:** <span style="color:green; font-size: 16px;">****264.5****</span> **FTPS**


****2 SplitDB explanation:****
![arangodb-benchmarking-split2](../../images/arangodb-benchmarking-split2.png)

During the performance benchmarking of ArangoDB, the utilization of a split database approach was used to optimize the FTPS. This configuration involved two main ArangoDB instances.

In the first instance, **Arango 1**, the split of data across distinct databases for specific purposes: **Pseudonyms**, **NetworkMap** for network configurations,  **TransactionHistory** to keep a record of transaction histories and the **Configuration** database stores rules and settings.

In the second instance, **Arango 2**, the **EvaluationResults** database was dedicated to storing the outcomes of transaction evaluations. This separation facilitated focused performance testing, allowing for precise measurement of the systemâ€™s response to distinct data management tasks within a multi-model database environment when reading and writing the data.

****4 SplitDB explaination:****

**Arango 1 - Configuration/NetworkMap Database**

The first instance, **Arango 1**, is responsible for storing configuration-related data. It contains the following databases and collections:

**Configuration**
- `transaction`
- `typologyExpression`
- `channelExpression`
- `configuration`

These collections are used for storing and retrieving configuration settings that dictate transaction processing and management rules.

**NetworkMap**

- `networkConfiguration`

This collection is crucial for maintaining the structural data of the network configurations.

**Arango 2 - Pseudonyms Database**

**Arango 2** focuses on pseudonymity and identity management within the system. The collections housed here are:

- `pseudonyms`
- `accounts`
- `account_holder`
- `entities`
- `transactionRelationship`

This instance is integral for privacy and identity management, ensuring that user data is mapped and managed securely.

**Arango 3 - Transaction History Database**

The **Arango 3** instance is tailored for transaction history storage. It includes:

- `transactionHistoryPacs002`
- `transactionHistoryPacs008`
- `transactionHistoryPain001`
- `transactionHistoryPain013`
- `list`
- `watchlist`

This instance serves as a historical data store, capturing all transaction details for auditing and reporting purposes.

**Arango 4 - Evaluation Results Database**

Lastly, **Arango 4** is dedicated to storing evaluation results in the `transactions` collection. It holds the output of transaction evaluations, serving as a data store for post-transaction analysis.

****The benchmarking includes:****
- Defining key performance indicators (KPIs) such as transactions per second (FTPS), latency, and resource utilization.
- Establishing a consistent test environment across all configurations to ensure comparability of results.
- Implementing repeatable test cases that simulate real-world usage scenarios to accurately measure database performance under each configuration.
- Utilizing Azure's native monitoring tools along with third-party benchmarking suites for a comprehensive performance assessment.
- Conducting multiple test iterations to account for variability and ensure statistical significance.

In this comprehensive analysis, which is based on examining the throughput of each configuration, as indicated by the FTPS metric. The analysis includes an evaluation of how effectively the configurations handle load, their responsiveness under stress, and their resilience in terms of fault tolerance and failover capabilities.

- **Single Instance:** With an **FTPS** of 2240, this configuration demonstrated reliable performance for scenarios not requiring high availability or distributed processing. It's particularly suited for development, testing, or smaller-scale production environments.
  - Cost for a small scale setup can be found here: [Infrastructure Spec for Tazama Sandbox](https://github.com/frmscoe/docs/blob/main/Technical/Environment-Setup/Infrastructure/Infrastructure-Spec-For-Tazama.md) 
- **2 Split Databases:** The **FTPS** of 2304.5 suggests a robust capability to handle more substantial workloads, especially read-heavy ones, while offering some level of scalability without the full complexity of clustering.
- **4 Split Databases:** The **FTPS** of 2496.83 indicates a strong ability to manage larger workloads, particularly those that are read-intensive. It also provides a degree of scalability without the need for the complete complexity of clustering.
- **Clustering:** Despite an **FTPS** of 264.5, the clustering configuration shines in high availability and horizontal scalability. It's built to endure high-load scenarios and provides the foundation for a resilient, enterprise-level deployment.

****Performance vs. Cost:****

The evaluation of performance against cost reveals an interesting dynamic between the configurations. The **Single Instance** configuration proved to be the most cost-effective, nearly matching the highest FTPS achieved by the Split Databases setup, which boasted the top performance. This demonstrates a high return on investment for the Single Instance in terms of performance per dollar. On the other end, the Clustering configuration, while being the most expensive and the slowest, is valued for its superior resilience and fault tolerance, features that are often required for mission-critical applications.

When considering the non-linear relationship between performance and cost, the Single Instance stands out for low- to medium-load scenarios where cost savings are paramount. In contrast, the additional expense of the Clustering setup is justified by its advanced capabilities, which are crucial for high-availability requirements despite its lower FTPS.

| Setup       | FTPS     | 3 Year Reserved $ Cost | 
|-------------|----------|------------------------|
| Single      | 2240     | **$14 843.84**        | 
| 2 SplitDB   | 2304.5   | **$20 575.82**        |
| 4 SplitDB   | 2496.83  | **$18 803.11**        |
| Cluser      | 264.5    | **$24 055.27**        |

****Cost-Performance Ratio:****

The cost-performance ratio is an essential metric for understanding the economic value of each configuration. A lower ratio signals better cost efficiency relative to performance:

- **Single Instance:** Demonstrates the best cost-performance ratio, indicating its status as the most economical option for the performance provided. Itâ€™s an ideal choice for organizations seeking to maximize their budget while still achieving robust performance levels.
- **2 Split Databases:** This configuration achieved the second FTPS. Although it comes with a higher cost than the Single Instance, its performance merits may justify the additional expense for workload scenarios that require swift read and write operations.
- **4 Split Databases:** This configuration achieved the highest FTPS, making it the top performer. While it is slightly more expensive than the Single Instance, it is more affordable than the 2 Split Database setup. Its exceptional performance may justify the additional expense for scenarios requiring fast read and write operations.
- **Clustering:** Despite having a less favorable cost-performance ratio due to its higher cost and lower FTPS, the Clustering configurationâ€™s value lies in its ability to maintain service continuity and manage distributed data, which can be critical for certain business operations.

In summary, the 4 Split Databases setup presents the most significant advantage in FTPS, yet organizations must weigh whether the performance gains are worth the additional costs, especially when compared to the surprisingly efficient Single Instance.

| Setup      | FTPS   | 3 Year Reserved $ Cost | Cost-Performance Ratio (Cost/FTPS) |
|------------|--------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Single     | 2240   | **$14,843.84**         | 6.63                                |
| 2 SplitDB  | 2304.5 | **$20,575.82**         | 8.93                                |
| 4 SplitDB  | 2496.83| **$18,803.11**         | 7.53                                |
| Cluster    | 264.5  | **$24,055.27**         | 90.97                               |

<span style="color:green; font-size: 24px;">****Improvement Steps****</span>

****Clustering****

For the Clustering configuration, our next step is a thorough review of our key usage within ArangoDB. The objective is to fully harness the capabilities of smart graphs, as detailed in ArangoDBâ€™s guide on transforming graphs to smart graphs ([Transforming Graphs to SmartGraphs](https://arangodb.com/learn/graphs/transforming-graph-to-smartgraph/)). By optimizing key distribution and ensuring that related data is co-located on the same shard, we anticipate a significant boost in performance for graph-related queries. SmartGraphs offer a promising path to achieve horizontal scalability and improved query efficiency for our graph data models, especially in distributed database setups.

**Example of the restructuring:**
<pre language="json">
{
  _id:"edge/+49-1725310+49-11111111"
  _key:"+49-1725310+49-11111111"
}


{_id:"1725310", cc:"+49"}
{_id:"9725954444", cc:"+1"}

{
  _id:"edge/+49:17253109725954444:+1"
  _key:"+49:17253109725954444:+1"
}
</pre>

By adopting these two enhancementsâ€”splitting databases across individual ArangoDB instances and optimizing our Clustering configuration with smart graph technology we can achieve not only higher transactions per second (FTPS) but also to establish a more cost-effective infrastructure. These advancements will be pivotal in scaling our database capabilities to meet the expanding demands of our applications while simultaneously maximizing performance and managing costs.

<span style="color:green; font-size: 24px;">****Final Completed Steps****</span>

Continuing to refine and enhance the ArangoDB deployment strategies, the aim to implement significant improvements that will further optimize performance, scalability, and efficiency. The focus was on two main areas: SplitDbs and Clustering.

****4 SplitDbs****

The final test for the SplitDbs configuration involves splitting each database onto its own dedicated ArangoDB single instance. This approach showed distribute the read and write operations more evenly, leveraging multiple instances of ArangoDB. By isolating databases, we improved the overall performance by parallelizing the operations but also enhance the maintainability and scalability of the system. This split enabled the fine-tune resources and configurations specific to the workload and usage patterns of each database.
