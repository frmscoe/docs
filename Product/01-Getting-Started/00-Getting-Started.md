**Step 1** : Developer Documentation - This documentation is used to setup your Tazama environment, what applications are used and a few knowledge articles. [Set up the environment](https://frmscoe.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FRMS/pages/1739872/Set+up+the+environment)

**Step 2** : Loading Rule Processors - Once your Tazama System is setup , read through the rule processors documentation on how each processor works and how it is configured. [Rule Processors](https://frmscoe.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FRMS/pages/1742143/Documentation)

**Step 3** : Develop New Rule - This step will be if you are creating a new rule or using the existing rules that are developed within your system [Rule Documentation](https://frmscoe.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FRMS/pages/1739869/Rule+Documentation)

**Step 4** : Test Rule - Once the rules are loaded and are ready for testing please follow these guidelines to make sure your are testing correctly including how to write postman and unit tests. [Rule Testing](https://frmscoe.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FRMS/pages/1742169/Rule+and+Rule+Processor+Testing)

**Step 5** : Definition Of Done - When steps 1 - 4 have been completed please make sure that any rule development abides by our definition of done [Definition of Done](https://frmscoe.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FRMS/pages/1742187/Definition+of+Done)

Demo videos have been recorded to show how some of the different applications work , how to test the rules/processors , E2E testing and so on. Please refer to the demo videos for a general walk through of the system. [Demo videos run through](https://frmscoe.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FRMS/pages/1742295/Demo+videos+run+through)
