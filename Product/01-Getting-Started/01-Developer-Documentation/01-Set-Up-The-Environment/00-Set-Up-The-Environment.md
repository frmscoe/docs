## Step 1

The **Tazama deployment guide** is used to deploy the Tazama platform from start to finish, where to find the repos, how to run the deployments and check deployments and configuration for each setup.

## Step 2

Read about the different applications we use within the platform.

1. Kubernetes
2. NATS
3. Protobuf
4. Keycloak
5. Elastic Search
6. Redis
7. NiFi
8. ArangoDB

## Step 3

Additional knowledge articles have been added for extra information but aren't needed for the environment setup. [Knowledge Articles](../frms-platform-developers-documentation/knowledge-articles.md)

## Step 4

Next step is to read through the rule processor documentation [Rule Processors](../frms-platform-developers-documentation/documentation.md)
